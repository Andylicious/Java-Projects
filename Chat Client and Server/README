Here, you will find a program written in java implementing a client/server chatter application. We will be making use of internet connections using sockets. 

Each process will consist of several threads:

To Specify a server: 
chatter [-@ flags] port

To specify a client:
chatter [-@ flags] hostname:port username 

This program has been tested on a unix timeshare.
